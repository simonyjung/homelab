# 🏡 homelab

## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to Simon's homelab documentation and configuration.
As someone that occasionally interviews Site Reliablity Engineers, I've always found myself to appreciate candidates with a nice homelab.
This is my attempt to learn and document my homelab so I can have better conversations with Site Reliability/DevOps Engineers. 

My work at Dendi uses AWS ECS for container orchestration, but that is not available to me locally so I will use Kubernetes to strengthen my understanding of container orchestration.

## 🖥️ Hardware

### Nodes

The nodes are 3 HP mini pcs purchased off ebay. They are small, have low electricity usage, and are cheap used.
