# 🏡 KC01 - homelab

## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to publicaly available documentation and configuration of KC01, Simon's homelab.
As someone that occasionally interviews Site Reliablity Engineers, I've always found myself to appreciate candidates with a nice homelab.
This is my attempt to learn and document my homelab so I can have better conversations with Site Reliability/DevOps Engineers.

### Nodes

See [ADR-0003](/adr/0003-node-hardware-os.md)

The nodes are 3 HP mini pcs purchased off ebay. They are small, have low electricity usage, and are cheap used.
