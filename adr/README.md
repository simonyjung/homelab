# Homelab Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that mimic key architectural decisions made by an engineering team. They clearly outline the context, decision, and rationale, facilitating future reference and decision-making.

## Structure of an ADR

Use the following sections to structure each ADR:

### Title

Brief and clear summary of the decision (e.g., "Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration").

### Status

- **Proposed**: Under consideration.
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented.
- **Rejected**: Considered but not implemented.
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR.

### Date

Date of decision.

### Context

Clearly describe the situation or problem that prompted this decision. Include relevant background information or specific challenges faced in your homelab.

### Decision

Clearly state the decision made. Include chosen tools, technologies, configurations, or standards.

### Rationale

Explain the reasoning behind this decision, including the advantages, trade-offs, and why alternative options were rejected.

### Consequences

List any significant outcomes or considerations as a result of this decision. Include dependencies, future work required, or potential risks.

## Template Example

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-04-27

## Context

Managing multiple containers and services manually became cumbersome and error-prone. Scalability and ease of management became critical requirements.

## Decision

Adopt Kubernetes as the primary container orchestration solution for managing workloads and deployments.

## Rationale

- Mature, widely adopted, and actively maintained.
- Strong community and ecosystem.
- Supports automated scaling and resource management.
- Excellent documentation and learning resources.

Alternatives such as Docker Swarm were considered but rejected due to lower feature richness and community support.

## Consequences

- Increased complexity in initial setup.
- Requires familiarity with Kubernetes concepts.
- Enables automated deployments and improved reliability.
```

## Usage

Store each ADR as a separate Markdown file within an `adr` directory in the homelab repository:

```
adr/
├── 0001-use-kubernetes.md
├── 0002-select-traefik-proxy.md
└── README.md
```

Update ADR statuses as needed to reflect the current state of decisions.
